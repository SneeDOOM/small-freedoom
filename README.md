# SmallFD

A fork of [fragglet's miniwad](https://github.com/fragglet/miniwad) inspired by their work on [SquashWare Doom](https://github.com/fragglet/squashware) - SmallFD is a fork of fraglet's miniwad except with some assets from FreeDoom


## What this will (probably) never include:

* Levels
* Music
* Some excess sprites

***TLDR: A BYOLM version of FreeDoom! (Bring Your Own Levels and Music!)***

## Why did you make this?

FreeDOOM is full of stuff not really needed to make FreeDOOM actually playable. This is a smaller variant of the iWAD for those who want to play FreeDOOM with their own level(s) on a toaster or something. Either that or for people who want to play DOOM maps without much excess bloat.
